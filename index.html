    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I&#39;m Unathi Mahlangabeza — a tech-driven problem solver with a growing passion for cloud computing. 
        I&#39;m currently pursuing my Microsoft Azure AZ-104 certification while building my expertise in 
        network support, system administration, and end-user solutions. This website captures my learning journey, 
        including highlights from the Cloud Resume Challenge and other hands-on projects.</p>

    <p>Outside the world of routers and servers, I&#39;m also a part-time freelance graphic designer. 
        I enjoy translating ideas into clean, impactful visuals — whether it&#39;s for a brand, a client, or my own portfolio. 
        Creativity and structure guide everything I do, both in tech and design.</p>
